1) coinc.C+
macro to prepare a tree with coincidences (TOF muon standalone analysis) --> out_digits##.root
it has to be run in compliation mode (+)

2) DoMerge.C
macro to merge output from serveral digits --> output.root

3) calib.C
macro to process (output 2) and produce some histos + a tree after some calibrations applied --> calib.root
it applies timeslewing (file to be downloaded from alien, see in the macro)
it reads TRM calibration from calib.txt if available
it produces newcal.txt with info to extract new calibration for TRM (see also 4)

4) align.C
it updates TRM offset calibration with the info provided in newcal.txt
it has to be run in iterative mode with calib.C
root -b -q -l calib.C
root -b -q -l align.C\(0\) // align only TOP sectors
root -b -q -l calib.C
root -b -q -l align.C\(1\) // align only BOTTOM sectors
root -b -q -l calib.C
... continue till you are happy, check calib.root
root -b -q -l align.C\(0\) // align only TOP sectors
root -b -q -l calib.C
root -b -q -l align.C\(1\) // align only BOTTOM sectors
...

5) fitFEA.C
Use TTree in calib.root to extract extra correction at FEA level (again iterative procedure)
Let's reming to uncoment related lines in calib.C
root -b -q -l calib.C
root fitFEA.C
root -b -q -l calib.C
